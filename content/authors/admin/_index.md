I train and provide technical support for researchers at [Open Ephys](https://open-ephys.org).
My focus is on open source tools for behavioral neuroscience: hardware and software for electrophysiology and neuronal imaging acquisition in freely behaving animals, as well as for behavioral recording and control.

I love crafting interactive activities to demo tools and concepts for workshops and scientific events, and strive to disseminate knowledge inclusively and accessibly, focusing on new users and language barriers.

I started volunteering and developing open science initiatives because I am passionate about teaching people new tools to help solve their problems and encouraging others to learn. One of my proudest moments was organizing workshops and a week long online course with fellow graduate students to bring open source to our side of the world, in Spanish. You can learn more about [Talleres Open Source](https://talleresos.netlify.app/) and use the [course materials](https://github.com/talleresopensource/taller-ibro-larc). We sent kits to 25 students from 8 countries across Latin America, and also had more participants follow the talks and recorded lectures. 

Previously, during my PhD at the Dynamical Systems Laboratory (UBA-CONICET, Argentina), I studied the neural coding of song production using extracellular electrophysiology. I built custom lightweight microdrives and used microwire tetrodes to record single-unit and LFP activity during song in canaries. You can check out my work and outreach on bioacoustics and sound visualization below.

Besides working in this space, I enjoy going to the beach and exploring the outdoors, cooking and trying new food, tinkering at home and live  music.
