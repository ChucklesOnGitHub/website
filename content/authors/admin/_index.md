I am currently studying neural coding of song production in canaries using electrophysiology. My research interests are in behavioural neuroscience. 

I promote open science and like to encourage people to try new tools that might help them solve their problems. 

I am interested in the intersection between education and technology and love doing outreach on bioacoustics and sound visualization.

I also enjoy playing the oboe and have been a member of several orchestras and ensembles.
