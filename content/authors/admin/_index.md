My research interests are in behavioural neuroscience. During my PhD at the Dynamical Systems Laboratory (UBA-CONICET), I studied the neural coding of song production in canaries using extracellular electrophysiology. I built a custom lightweight microdrive and used microwire tetrodes to record single-unit and LFP activity in freely behaving animals and wrote custom scripts to analyze the data. Check out my work and outreach on bioacoustics and sound visualization below.

I started volunteering and developing open science initiatives, since I am passionate about teaching people new tools to help solve their problems and encouraging others to learn. I now train researchers on about open source tools for neuroscience and behavior. I strive to disseminate this knowledge inclusively and accessibly, focusing on new users and language barriers.

I also enjoy DIY tutorials, baking, exploring outdoors, and playing the oboe in orchestra.
