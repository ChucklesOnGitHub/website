My research interests are in behavioural neuroscience. During my PhD I studied the neural coding of song production in canaries using extracellular electrophysiology. I built a custom lightweight microdrive and used microwire tetrodes to record single-unit and LFP activity in freely behaving animals and wrote custom scripts to analyze the data. Check out my work below.

I have recently started volunteering and developing open science initiatives, since I am passionate about teaching people new tools to help solve their problems and encouraging others to learn. I have always been interested in the intersection between education and technology and love doing outreach on bioacoustics and sound visualization.

I also enjoy everything DIY, baking and playing the oboe in orchestras.
