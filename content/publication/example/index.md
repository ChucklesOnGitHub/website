abstract: Vocal production in songbirds is a key topic regarding the motor
  control of a complex, learned behavior. Birdsong is the result of the
  interaction between the activity of an intricate set of neural nuclei
  specifically dedicated to song production and learning (known as the “song
  system”), the respiratory system and the vocal organ. These systems interact
  and give rise to precise biomechanical motor gestures which result in song
  production. Telencephalic neural nuclei play a key role in the production of
  motor commands that drive the periphery, and while several attempts have been
  made to understand their coding strategy, difficulties arise when trying to
  understand neural activity in the frame of the song system as a whole. In this
  work, we report neural additive models embedded in an architecture compatible
  with the song system to provide a tool to reduce the dimensionality of the
  problem by considering the global activity of the units in each neural
  nucleus. This model is capable of generating outputs compatible with
  measurements of air sac pressure during song production in canaries (Serinus
  canaria). In this work, we show that the activity in a telencephalic nucleus
  required by the model to reproduce the observed respiratory gestures is
  compatible with electrophysiological recordings of single neuron activity in
  freely behaving animals.
