abstract: Vocal production in songbirds is a key topic regarding the motor
  control of a complex, learned behavior. Birdsong is the result of the
  interaction between the activity of an intricate set of neural nuclei
  specifically dedicated to song production and learning (known as the “song
  system”), the respiratory system and the vocal organ. These systems interact
  and give rise to precise biomechanical motor gestures which result in song
  production. Telencephalic neural nuclei play a key role in the production of
  motor commands that drive the periphery, and while several attempts have been
  made to understand their coding strategy, difficulties arise when trying to
  understand neural activity in the frame of the song system as a whole. In this
  work, we report neural additive models embedded in an architecture compatible
  with the song system to provide a tool to reduce the dimensionality of the
  problem by considering the global activity of the units in each neural
  nucleus. This model is capable of generating outputs compatible with
  measurements of air sac pressure during song production in canaries (Serinus
  canaria). In this work, we show that the activity in a telencephalic nucleus
  required by the model to reproduce the observed respiratory gestures is
  compatible with electrophysiological recordings of single neuron activity in
  freely behaving animals.

  caption: "Grouped neural activity data across different birds and example air
    sac pressure trace. (a) Top panel: raster plot of spiking activity of seven
    neurons in eight unique P1 phrases from four different animals. Only the
    first 12 syllables in each phrase are shown. On the vertical axis, each line
    corresponds to one repetition of a phrase and each color represents an
    individual neuron. Middle panel: grouped activity histogram for the neurons
    shown in the raster plot and smoothed histogram curve. Bin size = 15 ms.
    Bottom panel: example of the air sac pressure recorded in one animal during
    the production of a P1 phrase. (b) Same information as in (a), the raster
    plot shows seven neurons in five different P0 syllables from five animals.
    The pressure trace in the third panel corresponds to a representative
    example recorded during production of a P0 syllable in the same animal as in
    (a)."
