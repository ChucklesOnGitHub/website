abstract: The nervous system representation of a motor program is an open
  problem for most behaviors. In birdsong production, it has been proposed that
  some special temporal instances, linked to significant aspects of the motor
  gestures used to generate the song, are preferentially represented in the
  cortex. In this work, we compute these temporal instances for two species, and
  report which of them is better suited to test the proposed coding (as well as
  alternative models) against data.
